# Poddammit (or For the Love of Pod)! [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d403f3e8-a409-4786-bd69-aa8894a1e9dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/poddammit/deploys)
## Nashville Software School - Cohort E14 - Final Capstone
### DEPLOYED APP
poddammit.netlify.app 
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
As a typical millennial, I love true crime podcasts, especially when hosted by comedians. However, sometimes I want different subject matter or a more serious presentation. I spend too much time scrolling through Spotify, yet I always end up listening to the same 4 shows. 

For my capstone project, I want to create a podcast-only Spotify clone that provides recommendations, filtered search functionality, a shuffler, and the ability to add items to playlists.

My driving motivation is to learn and practice Vue.js on the frontend, while interacting with both an external and an internal API on the backend.

### USER STORIES
- As a user, I want to register for the app, so that I can find podcast shows and episodes by subject matter.
    -  Given that I want to listen to a specific type of show, when I select specific filters and submit, then recommended shows are returned. 
    - The same is true for episodes. The search UI will provide the option to search by episode, search by show, or both.

- As an authenticated user, I want to be able to save shows and episodes to my playlists, so that I can listen to them later.
    - Given that I find a show I like, when I click the "heart" button, then the item is stored to a list.

- As an authenticated user, I want the option to find a random item to listen to, so that I can discover new content.
    - Given that I want random content without using search filters, when I click "shuffle," then a random show is returned. 
    - The shuffle UI will provide the option to shuffle by episode, shuffle by show, or both.
